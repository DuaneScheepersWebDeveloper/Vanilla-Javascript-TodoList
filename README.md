Vanilla-Javascript-TodoList
This is a simple vanilla Javascript project I created for my Codespace project submission.
The App makes use of all CRUD operations used in many web applications.In particular this app was written in Javascript, HTML and CSS.

On how to use the application there is a white bar at the top of the page, enter a
task you would like to do. Once you have typed in your task choose a category of what you would like your task to fall under(personal or for work). Click the 'Add a new task' button to add your task. Your task will appear below the button. You can click on the round circle icon to tick off your task once you have done it. The app will change the styling of the bar once you have completed your task. You can delete or edit the task with the 2 action buttons on the right hand side.

These are some of the features:
-You are able to create new tasks.
-You are able to decide what categories you want your tasks allocated to.
-You can view your tasks
-You can Edit existing tasks
-You can check your tasks off as you complete them
-You can delete tasks .
-You can save your tasks to local storage.

The App makes use of OOP classes, Javascript conditionals, Event listeners and various other methods.

To the person marking my project; I would greatly appreciate any feedback on how I can improve this app and what I can be doing better.

Kind Regards Duane Scheepers
ps.my contacts can be found in the footer of the application.
